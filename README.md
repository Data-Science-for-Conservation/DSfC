# The Data Science for Conservation Project

Aldo Leopold is considered to be one of the "founding fathers" of wildlife conservation in America. And thanks in large part to his writing, one of the seven tenets of the [North American Model of Wildlife Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Model_of_Wildlife_Conservation) is that science should form the basis for informed management and decision-making processes.

In that spirit, the Data Science for Conservation Project applies data science tools to better analyze, understand, and visualize conservation issues. This repository holds a directory for each project, which are in the process of being moved here:
